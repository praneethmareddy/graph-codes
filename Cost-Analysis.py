Hourly Pricing for m8g Instances

| Instance Type     | Hourly Cost (USD) |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| m8g.large         | $0.08976          |
| m8g.12xlarge      | $1.344            |
| m8g.24xlarge      | $4.30848          |

Static Allocation Cost

Using the highest-tier instance (m8g.metal-48xl) continuously for 24 hours:

Static Cost = 24 * $8.61696 = $206.80704


---

Dynamic Allocation Cost

Dynamic usage based on actual 3-hour intervals per flavour:

| Instance Type     | Hours Used | Cost Per Hour | Total Cost |
|-------------------|------------|----------------|------------|
| m8g.large         | 3          | $0.08976       | $0.26928   |
| m8g.12xlarge      | 6          | $1.344         | $8.064     |
| m8g.24xlarge      | 6          | $4.30848       | $25.85088  |
| m8g.48xlarge      | 6          | $8.61696       | $51.70176  |
| m8g.metal-48xl    | 3          | $8.61696       | $25.85088  |
---------------------------------------------------------------
| **Total Dynamic Cost**                              | $111.7368  |

(Note: m8g.48xlarge appears twice in the timeline, so counted twice. Same with others where applicable.)

Savings Calculation

Savings = Static Cost - Dynamic Cost
        = $206.80704 - $111.7368
        = $95.07024

Percentage Saving = (Savings / Static Cost) * 100
                  = ($95.07024 / $206.80704) * 100
                  â‰ˆ 45.97%
